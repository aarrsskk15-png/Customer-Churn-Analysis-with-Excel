## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The *Customer Churn Dashboard* provides a complete overview of customer attrition behavior, segmented by demographics, usage patterns, and competitor activity.

It helps answer key questions such as:
- What is the *overall churn rate*?
- Which *age groups* are most likely to churn?
- How does *data consumption* affect churn?
- Which *states* or *regions* have the highest churn rates?
- What *competitor factors* drive customer loss?
